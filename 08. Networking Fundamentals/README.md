# Networking Fundamentals


### Step 1



    • Level 3: Network.

### Step 2



    • Level 2: Data
    • Port 22 is the default port and should be closed..

### Step 3



    • Level 5: Session. 
    • This is DNS Spoofing and can reroute web pages.
    • Use encryption like SSL/TLS which would prevent or mitigate the possibility of a website being compromised by DNS Spoofing.

### Step 4



    • Duplicate IP is Level 3: Network.
    • This is an ARP poisoning attack. Traffic can be routed to a malicious device instead of the intended destination.
    • Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) can be configured to limit the rate at which ARP messages can pass through the switch.
