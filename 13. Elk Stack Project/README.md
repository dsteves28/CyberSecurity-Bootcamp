## Automated ELK Stack Deployment

The files in this repository were used to configure the network depicted below.

![TODO: Update the path with the name of your diagram](Images/diagram_filename.png)

These files have been tested and used to generate a live ELK deployment on Azure. They can be used to either recreate the entire deployment pictured above. Alternatively, select portions of the _____ file may be used to install only certain pieces of it, such as Filebeat.

  - _TODO: Enter the playbook file._

This document contains the following details:
- Description of the Topologu
- Access Policies

### Description of the Topology

The main purpose of this network is to expose a load-balanced and monitored instance of DVWA, the D*mn Vulnerable Web Application.

Load balancing ensures that the application will be highly _____, in addition to restricting _____ to the network.
- _TODO: What aspect of security do load balancers protect? What is the advantage of a jump box?_

Integrating an ELK server allows users to easily monitor the vulnerable VMs for changes to the _____ and system _____.
- _TODO: What does Filebeat watch for?_
- _TODO: What does Metricbeat record?_

The configuration details of each machine may be found below.

| Name     | Function | IP Address | Operating System |
|----------|----------|------------|------------------|
| Jump Box | Gateway  | 10.0.0.1   | Linux            |
| TODO     |          |            |                  |
| TODO     |          |            |                  |
| TODO     |          |            |                  |

### Access Policies

The machines on the internal network are not exposed to the public Internet. 

Only the _____ machine can accept connections from the Internet. Access to this machine is only allowed from the following IP addresses:
- _TODO: Add whitelisted IP addresses_

Machines within the network can only be accessed by _____.
- _TODO: Which machine did you allow to access your ELK VM? What was its IP address?_

A summary of the access policies in place can be found in the table below.

| Name     | Publicly Accessible | Allowed IP Addresses |
|----------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Jump Box | Yes/No              | 10.0.0.1 10.0.0.2    |
|          |                     |                      |
|          |                     |                      |

### Elk Configuration

Ansible was used to automate configuration of the ELK machine. No configuration was performed manually, which is advantageous because...
- _TODO: What is the main advantage of automating configuration with Ansible?_

The playbook implements the following tasks:
- _TODO: In 3-5 bullets, explain the steps of the ELK installation play. E.g., install Docker; download image; etc._
- ...
- ...

The following screenshot displays the result of running `docker ps` after successfully configuring the ELK instance.

### Target Machines & Beats
This ELK server is configured to monitor the following machines:
- _TODO: List the IP addresses of the machines you are monitoring_

We have installed the following Beats on these machines:
- _TODO: Specify which Beats you successfully installed_

These Beats allow us to collect the following information from each machine:
- _TODO: In 1-2 sentences, explain what kind of data each beat collects, and provide 1 example of what you expect to see. E.g., `Winlogbeat` collects Windows logs, which we use to track user logon events, etc._

### Using the Playbook
In order to use the playbook, you will need to have an Ansible control node already configured. Assuming you have such a control node provisioned: 

SSH into the control node and follow the steps below:
- Copy the _____ file to _____.
- Update the _____ file to include...
- Run the playbook, and navigate to ____ to check that the installation worked as expected.

_TODO: Answer the following questions to fill in the blanks:_
- _Which file is the playbook? Where do you copy it?_
- _Which file do you update to make Ansible run the playbook on a specific machine? How do I specify which machine to install the ELK server on versus which to install Filebeat on?_
- _Which URL do you navigate to in order to check that the ELK server is running?

_As a **Bonus**, provide the specific commands the user will need to run to download the playbook, update the files, etc._
